Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.

Python is known for its simple, readable syntax.
It uses indentation to define code blocks.

Popular Python frameworks include Django and Flask for web development.
For data science, libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn are widely used.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms:
- Object-oriented programming
