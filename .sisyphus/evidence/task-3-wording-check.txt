# Task 3: AGENTS.md Wording Check for Cursor/Copilot References

## Verification Result: PASS

### Check Performed
- Searched AGENTS.md for references to Cursor and Copilot rule files
- Specifically checked for mentions of:
  - `.cursorrules`
  - `.cursor/rules/`
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - "Cursor rules"
  - "Copilot instructions"

### Finding
**NO false claims found.** AGENTS.md does NOT claim these files exist.

The document accurately describes repository guidelines without referencing optional rule files that are not present. Wording is appropriate and does not assume existence of Cursor/Copilot configuration files.

### AGENTS.md Content Analysis
AGENTS.md contains:
- Repository overview
- Environment requirements
- Commands (Frontend/Backend)
- Code style guidelines
- Test resource constraints
- Critical implementation notes
- Repository-specific notes

None of these sections falsely reference or depend on Cursor/Copilot rule files.

## Conclusion
AGENTS.md wording is correct and consistent with the actual state (rule files are absent).
